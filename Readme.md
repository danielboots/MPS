## **About the project**

**Music Production Service** is my own business which i run successfully in the music industry. 
I decided to approach rebuilding the website using the skills i have learned so far from the first modules of the **'Full Stack Developer Course'** from **Code Institute**.

I aim to complete the website following web best practices and also to fulfill my need to present my business information on a website which is not only well structured but is also mobile responsive. 

It should have a a professional look about it and also is not overly complicated with regards to UX navigation and content layout so that potential clients can visit the website and find what they are looking for.


As a business owner my end goal is to convert visitors to the site to customers not only that but to capture leads through contact forms and relevant _call to actions_ such as **newsletter signup forms**.


## **Technologies Used**
___

* **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML):** - Is the main language used in this project which allowed me to correctly structure the website, whereby using best practices to use semantic tags where appropriate.

* **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS):** - Was used via an external stylesheet using best practices to style format and visually present the HTML.

* **[JAVASCRIPT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript):** - *As part of Bootstrap* Javascript although i havent programmed it, was included in the site as part of the Bootstrap framework so that some Bootstrap components such as the navigation toggler would work.

* **[JQUERY](https://jquery.com/):** - *Again only employed as part of Bootstrap so that Bootstrap components work as expected.*

* **[BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/):** - The framework for the site allowing use of the Bootstrap grid and responsive mobile first approach. I Used many components from Bootstrap mainly, the Carousel, Nav bar, forms and modals.
