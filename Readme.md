## üìì **About the project:**

**Music Production Service** is my own business which i run successfully in the music industry. 
I decided to approach rebuilding the website using the skills i have learned so far from the first modules of the **'Full Stack Developer Course'** from **Code Institute**.

I aim to complete the website following web best practices and also to fulfill my need to present my business information on a website which is not only well structured but is also mobile responsive. 

It should have a a professional look about it and also is not overly complicated with regards to UX navigation and content layout so that potential clients can visit the website and find what they are looking for.


As a business owner my end goal is to convert visitors to the site to customers not only that but to capture leads through contact forms and relevant _call to actions_ such as **newsletter signup forms**.


## üíªÔ∏è **Technologies Used:**
___

* **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML):** - Is the main language used in this project which allowed me to correctly structure the website, whereby using best practices to use semantic tags where appropriate.

* **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS):** - Was used via an external stylesheet using best practices to style format and visually present the HTML.

* **[JAVASCRIPT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript):** - *As part of Bootstrap* Javascript although i havent programmed it, was included in the site as part of the Bootstrap framework so that some Bootstrap components such as the navigation toggler would work.

* **[JQUERY](https://jquery.com/):** - *Again only employed as part of Bootstrap so that Bootstrap components work as expected.*

* **[BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/):** - The framework for the site allowing use of the Bootstrap grid and responsive mobile first approach. I Used many components from Bootstrap mainly, the Carousel, Nav bar, forms and modals. 

* **[GITPOD](https://gitpod.io/):** - IDE for this project. Allowed me to fork the Code Institute template from Github and open in Gitpod so that all extenstions were available.

* **[GIT](https://git-scm.com/):** Git employed as version control

* **[GITHUB](https://github.com/):** - Github was used to host the repository for this project.

* **[SQUOOSH](https://squoosh.app/):** - I used Squoosh in order to reduce the image sizes

* **[PHOTOSHOP](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html):** - For editing images associated with this project.

* **[BALSAMIQ](https://balsamiq.com/):** - Mac version to develop wireframes for this project.

## üßë‚Äçüé® **UX:** 
___
I have carried out a full UXD report as this is a functioning business already operating and 
UX has never been addressed it would be a good time as ever to carry one out. The full report can be found here: **[UXD Report](/assets/UXD-MPS.pdf):**

For your reference i have also provided a general overiew of my analysis. 


## **Strategy plane: The Initial idea.**
___
The strategy plane or initial idea for this project centres around coupling a rebuild of a current website using the latest technologies I have learned to also satisfy my user centric front end design milestone project. 
The business is entirely online and is concerned with music production services. From Mixing, mastering, track production, consulting etc with the primary aim of the website to display that information and get the potential client to contact me directly to discuss their needs further.

## **About the business:**
The business is entirely online and is concerned with music production services. From Mixing, mastering, track production, consulting etc with the primary aim of the website to display that information and get the potential client to contact me directly to discuss their needs further.

**Strategy to deliver above.**
* A clear and simple design starting with the Hero section displaying the Name and tag line to establish the message of
the site.
*  Landing page explains through a text box About the site in the first section.
*  First section to demonstrate our work ‚Äì Music video visually representing our latest work and major client ‚Äì this will
increase conversions through association.
* A clear selection on the landing page to address our top services with clear navigation to explore this further.
* Addition of a Call to action within the navigation bar and on the landing page will also allow the potential client to
realise we are encouraging getting in touch with us.

#### **strategy plane continued in full lengh analysis .pdf**


## **Scope Plane - requirements and functional specifcation**
___
### **What users and stakeholders - Say they need**

* The user visiting this type of website wants a professional website showing prior work and a way to get music production services.

### **What users and stakeholders - Actually need**

* They need a clean and tidy designed website which is mobile responsive, highlighting previous work, the music producer who will be working for them and a list of previous clients and labels who we as the business owners can get them in touch with. They need a site that gives them information based on what they are searching for. So a prioritised section of the website for said services, additional information on the services and an opportunity to discuss the project with a real life person over the phone or on email.
 
 ### **What users and stakeholders - Don't know they need.**

* As a working business website, we have to abide by GDPR rules, so a pop up advising the client on our privacy and how we use their information would be needed down the production line.
* A merchandise store ‚Äì an opportunity to increase revenue as a more B2C standard practice.
* Plans to develop an online booking system and also allow other checked and vetted music producers to use the
* platform and develop more of a directory of professional services. This would lead to the site becoming more of a social and membership platform, which is hopefully going to be added during the course and is already added to the priority matrix.
* Other desirable features may include, online reviews, more services for music promotion and education, through a LMS or one to one coaching. These services would beneft not only the user but the business owner as he can monetise these features whilst ofering more services to the client. This is already touched upon in 'client consulting' but not to an extent where LMS would be introduced, this would in fact make it easier for the business owner as the LMS would automate a lot of the content.
* Social networking feature ‚Äì not essential but desirable, perhaps a twitter/sound-cloud like entity where users can register to the site share their music tips and advice, this would allow for content to be shared cross platform and to other social media accounts, drastically increasing awareness of our web application.
* An iOS and android app ‚Äì its true that many users now if these features down the line are implemented that developing an application would be of extreme beneft, it would allow extra monetisation brand awareness and next level professionalism, as far as I am aware there are no such apps with the previous aforementioned features bundled into one. This could be an avenue to explore in the future.

#### **Scope plane continued in full lengh analysis .pdf**


## **Structure: How we present information:**
___

The web application will consist of a typical navigation and structure which will conform to web best practices. By this we would expect the navigation menu items to be located to the top right hand corner of the web app. To the left we will employ a Navigation bar logo which doubles as a main Home or index.html link.
As it stands there will only be 4 pages and one enquiry button, which brings up a modal with a contact form. The menu items are only one level consisting of a linear structure, so no nested pages as of yet. The structure is as follows.
#### **HOME---ABOUT---SERVICES---CONTACT---ENQUIRE:**

### **Information on structure regarding page layout and design.:**

The general structure of pages will consist of a nav bar, a hero section and then relative content to that page, structured using the projects fonts, font sizing and colour palette.
* As discussed earlier I have opted for a content block approach which will allow me to display content in a clean and structured manner. These two points allow the user to learn the layout and feel of the website quickly.
* Each page will have working navigation whereby the logo (a musical note) will return the user to the home or landing page.
* I have added a CTA button inside of the nav bar as I feel this works well for what i'm trying to achieve ‚Äì clicking this will open a modal with a contact form.
* The footer consists of three sections positioned centrally and away from the edges of the site so that any information can be viewed with out scanning from left to right on larger screen resolutions. I discovered this as I work on a 27inch iMac and having content full width at this size is bad for UX in my personal experience.
    * Regarding the footer, section one or block one will have an information box
    * section two will display a quick navigation section with links so the user can navigate to any page from the bottom of the site instead of scrolling back to the top.
    * Section 3 will comprise of my social media font awesome icons clickable and attributed with target‚Äù_blank‚Äù so they open in a new tab in the browser, ensuring the user doesn't leave the main site.
* The carousel feature of Bootstrap has been used so that I can display multiple scrolling testimonials without taking up to much space on the webpage, I also styled this section so it acts as a content separator.
* The card deck and cards have been used for the Services sections of the website, I feel this works well as I like the way the information is displayed on the website, indicating an image of the service and a text box positioned below so I can give further information about the service.
* The services page in particular employs a quick nav bar using #ID's so that potential clients can quickly pick a category they wish to explore without scrolling through every option. This will become more important for UX when more categories and services are added.

### **IXD:**

* Hero section is not full viewport height with next sections always visible, this promotes scrolling and intrigue.
* Colours fonts and structure are reused throughout the site.
* Minimal use of external libraries and hover states, I only employed hover states on buttons and on nav bar link hovers
as I don't want to distract from the main purpose of the site.
* I did however add an animation class from Animista which was used throughout the site on the hero text and strap line,
it plays once on page load and is a fade animation, which I feel adds a subtle but impressive introduction when visiting pages. No further animations are employed.

#### **structure plane continued in full lengh analysis .pdf**


## **Skeleton Plane ‚Äì Interface design, navigation design and giving form to function:**
___

* As with every project which is to be taken in to production it was essential to frstly wireframe the project. This would allow me to test out diferent ideas layouts, navigation and presentation which is expected when visiting this type of website. I developed the wireframes using the Balsamiq software which allowed me to produce low fdelity mockups of the fnished web application without the need for coding it frst. This saves on production time and allows us to have a 'map' of how to fnally code the app.
Please note ‚Äì these wireframes may difer slightly from the end result, for example after the website was completed I added a quick enquiry button to the nav bar and a few styling changes.

#### **Contact Page - Wireframe **

### **Skeleton plane cont:**
In this project we are only focusing on data presented, and will be future enhance this project with data at rest and data in motion.
However as we are only concerned with the frontend HTML CSS and a small amount of Javascript I have only focused my UX on data presented.
The data presented should provide good usability and at current is only concerned with a few features, contacting through CTA and presenting the information using tools such as cards and carousels. As there are very few features and a sole aim at contacting through the site this should alleviate cognitive overload from the end user.
Navigation has been assembled in order of priority from left to right and all links and internal links are well displayed (many as buttons) and working.
Furthermore I found no need for pagination to display data and also provided menu items and buttons with relevant font awesome icons to aid in web application learning to the end user. Data is presented the same throughout the web app alongside colours, fonts and branding all aiming to allow the end user to learn the web app easily and enjoy using it.


### **Surface plane cont:**
Using all the planes above and the data presentation and all the research carried out I was able to present all of this with my project.
I hope you enjoy browsing my web app and I look forward to developing it further.
In ending this UXD analysis and a quote I feel summarises this whole process I will leave you with this.

## üì¶Ô∏è **Features:**
___

* The web app is totally mobile responsive with a collapsible toggler navigation. 
* The site has features such as Youtube and Soundcloud embeded into it.
* I used a parallax style Hero and separator sections for modern display of content. 
* Menu items highlight on mouseover.
* The carousel has before and next and previous buttons so that users can choose to read or go back to different testimonials.
* The site utilises modals for forms so users can quickly get in touch with the site owner.
* The Logo position left always takes the user back to the Home page.
* Google Maps used so that users can see the business location.
* Social media icons are active and link to relative external platforms.
* Expected use of font awesome icons to assist in users learning of the site.
* Navigation button modal - to increase conversions. 
* Use of animation for hero text - minimal use of animation but effective for a pleasureable experience on page load.
* Use of Category ID nav on services page, allows users to quickly find the section of services they require. 
* Footer features on every page with infomation bar, nav links and social links easily accessible.
* Navigation is structured from level of importance left to right. 
* Services section utilises bootstrap cards which display image and content relevant to the user is looking for.


## üß™ **Testing:**
___

Testing was an integral part of the design and build process, responsiveness is cruicial to the success of any online website so a number of steps were employed to ensure that the site worked across a number of platforms and browsers.
Not only responsiveness but positioning, colours, inheritence etc were all factors to be taken into consideration, thus Google Chrome developer tools was used extensively to test all aspects of the site.
Although Bootstrap is a mobile first approach i opted to work on a simple desktop version first as i could work backwards.
I first of all set up a few .css rules for the body section which allowed me to set some global rules such as.

<!-- Code Blocks -->
``` Css
  * {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
Which made sure that i was working with the box model more logically. 

##Real world example of debugging using Chrome Dev tools.

Chrome dev tools also allowed me to test inheritence in _**CSS**_ and test different rules and sizing to ensure that my content was displaying correctly on a number of browsers and screen size emulations.
One such example was when i was nearing the end of the project where i found that the Hero text **Music Production Service** displayed in the center on all screen resolutions but not on my Apple iPhone it was pushed further down than expected. 

Screenshot 1 : Opening the website in dev tools.

![Screen1-Devtools-testing](/images/devtool1.png)

Screenshot 2 : Ammending the .css rule and making a media query to fix

![Screen2-Devtools-css-fix](/images/devtool2.png)


I opened the dev tools inside of Chrome and adjusted the screen size and made the correct media query to remedy the issue using this media query. 


``` Css

@media all and (max-width: 425px) {
    .hero-text {
    text-align: center;
    position: absolute;
    top: 30%;
    left: 10%;
    right: 10%;
    color: white;
}
```

One other major factor i came across is when using `.container-fluid` my content was as expected at full width across the screen, which for some sections i liked but on bigger screen resolutions i found for UX purposes i needed to set a max width so that the content didnt spread across the page. I found this looked sloppy and not good in terms of design. I tested this too out with dev tools to create a `.container-max` rule which for large screen resolutions the content was displayed better.


## **User Experience testing:**

As this website is aimed at getting clients to interact with the site through booking or enquiring about a service i had to ensure that in my testing i adequately tested the UX and that it was simple enough for the user to "learn" how to use the site and follow industry standards and user expectations. 

* This translated in to me using a top menu bar with LOGO positioned to the left and menu items positioned on the right. 
* Mobile responsiveness i chose to have a right hand side positioned Hamburger / toggler nav which presented the menu options in a neat and decluttered way. 
* I used many inbound links and tested all links ensuring that they all work and link correctly.
* All social media icons link to the right external pages using the `target="_blank"` attribute so that external pages are opened in a new tab.
* I tested all parts of the website including Bootstrap components, as i used:  
    1. the NAV bar - Tested on all pages and on Firefox, Chrome and Safari, also on iOS iPhone all working correctly. 
    1. Modal as a button CTA which includes an enquiry form - Although the form isnt functioning it was tested again Tested on all pages and on Firefox, Chrome and Safari, also on iOS iPhone all working correctly.
    1. Carousel for testimonials - Tested on all pages and on Firefox, Chrome and Safari, also on iOS iPhone all working correctly.




### **Utilising Mentor Sessions:**
After my initial mentor session to discuss the idea and scope of the project i made sure that i could bring the project as far to completion as possible so that i could use his expertise in our next session. 
I had a number of issues which Allen helped me rectify. Notibly the Navbar brand logo sizing, a carousel issue and footer links which have been noted as comments in my .CSS file.

### **Further Testing:**

* The use of validation services for **[Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)** and **[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)** allowed me to modify and fix any errors in my code, one highlight of using these validation services especially in CSS was that i was repeating alot of the same rules for font colour, the validation service allowed me to remove alot of  those rules and condense them into one rule which made a lot more sense.
* I Used the Gitpod built in html testing as seen below![iframe testing error on HTML validator](/images/testing.png) which ended up being a great learning tool spotting errors or unclosed ```<.div>``` etc.
I should also add that this tool brought to my attention that as i was using multiple forms on pages that my ID's needed to be unique, an issue which was quickly rectified but easily overlooked. 
* I finally used **[GTMETRIX](https://gtmetrix.com/)** which is used to test page website speeds. All testing came back fine apart from image sizes which scored pretty low. Thus i used the free online **[SQUOOSH](https://squoosh.app/)** to reduce massive image sizes upto 80% of their original file size. This is especially important as large image sizes dramatically increase page loading speeds and leads to a bad UX especially on mobile where heavy loading sites can eat data very quickly. 


### **Testing Issues:**

One issue which doesnt affect UX but didnt pass the validation was the inclusion of youtube embed code, specifically the **iframe** i will add this to my future development so that i can embed youtube videos without the need of **iframe**

### **_HTML Validation error when using Youtube embed._**

## üè≠Ô∏è **Deployment:**
This project was developed using the Gitpod IDE which integrates seemlessly with Github, Git pod is a cloud IDE so this allowed me to work at home on my imac or out on my imac using only an internet connection and the website **[GITPOD workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/).** 

The site was developed inside of the Gitpod IDE and connected to my GitHub repository. 
As sections of the site were completed i ensured that i used version control to maintain copies of my code on the repository. This was achieved via commands on the terminal integrated with Gitpod.

### **Steps in using version control and getting ready for Deployment**

1. `git status` - would give me a list of the files which have been edited and ready for staging.
1. `git add .` - I used this command to add **all** files to the staging area instead of adding each file individually i used the `.` after `Git add` which allowed all files to be added at once, i found this workflow quicker and easier.
1. `git commit -m"Message"` - This is the command to commit the changes and the message allowed me to know what or significant changes had been made.
1. `git push` - Was used to push to the remote repository in this case **GitHub**

When working it was also neccessary to view the changes to the website, for this i mainly used preview, as the save function allowed instant refreshes and updates reflecting my changes. However for fullscreen testing in a separate tab i employed the use of the command `python3 -m http.server"` to open a port on my local machine, instructions were to make the port public then open in browser. 

_**Side note**_ I also had to become aquianted with  `git pull` and also  `git reset --hard commit-hash` as i had a problem with my project after a commit i then used the previous commands to restore my local repo from Githubs last correct commit, saving a major headache.
i then had to re push the repo back using `git push -f`

### **Thanks** 

I wish to add a special mention to my mentor **[Allen Thomas Varghese](https://github.com/allentv)** Who as my mentor helped me throughout the project assisting me with any problems i came across and gave me advice on how to fix the last 10% of my code, from providing solutions to logo sizing and position, also that i should justify my text. I have credited any code snippets from my mentor in my css as comments such as: 

``` Css
/* mentor help */
ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding-inline-start: 0px;

  .justify {
  text-align: justify;
}
  ```

  He also explained why my RGBA values werent passing validation and told me to use Hex values throughout for example.

  ``` CSS
  .overlay::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  /* change RGBA to HEX Alpha 'Mentor Suggestion' */
  background: #24252bcf;
}
```

_**Finally to my girlfriend who has allowed me to work day and night on this project. Who gave birth to our second child my daughter Abbie only a month ago, who i could thank for not being too bad on night feeds and also my son Alfie who sleeps all night now. If not i think i would have crashed due to lack of sleep.**_ ü•∞
